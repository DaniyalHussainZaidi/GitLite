# GitLite
This project implements a Git version control system designed for large files and distributed servers. Instead of resending entire files after every update, the system uses tree-based storage, Merkle hashing, and node-level synchronization to transfer only the changed parts. This makes collaboration faster, more secure, and highly efficient.
